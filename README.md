### WomenTechWomenYes Gala Outreach
For this project, an organization dedicated to women's participation in the tech industry asked us to conduct an analysis to optimize the timing and placement of street teams who are trying to sell tickets to their annual gala. We conducted an exploratory data analysis in Python of NYC MTA subway turnstile data to identify high traffic subway stations, times of the day, and days of the week that could result in higher visibility and participation.

#### Tools:
Python (Pandas, Numpy)
#### Methods:
Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Data Visualization:
Matplotlib
